## About me

Not long after discovering Hive Helsinki I quit my retail sales to pursue a career in coding.  
Hive brought up my innate ability to solve problems and I enjoy finding patterns in code.  
I got instantly hooked and now after a bountiful year in school its time to test my skills in my first internship.

Hive is free coding school funded by Supercell. As I started in Oct 2021 totally new to all programming concepts,
I've attained great solid fundamentals for my professional career thanks to Hives "untraditional" learning methods.

### Back to source, all projects must be built from scratch:  
  Allowed functions for most part: malloc, free and write;  
  Allowed library string.h for NULL and size_t variables;  
  
### Evaluation, emulates real life github process of getting ones code validated.  
  All leaks and unexpected crashes (be it segfault or bus error) results in failing grade and;
  downtime of 1 to 7 days like in unit tests intervals in real life;  
  All projects must pass 3 to 5 processes of:  
  - Tests and evaluation form provided by school,  
  - Rigorous tests the evaluator has prepared;  
  
### Peer to peer, No lessons, No teachers. 
  - Develops soft skills since you will have to rely on student body and working as a group,  
  - Improves terminology;
  
### Norm, rules to improve readability and predictability of ones code. 
  All code must be written according to the school 42 norm, a multiple page document designed to make code clearer.  
  Here is couple examples:
  - All functions must be max 25 lines, 
  - 5 variables / function,
  - 5 functions / .c-file,
  - 80 charecters / line,
  - no variable assigning inside statements;
