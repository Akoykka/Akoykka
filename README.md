## About me

Im who careershifted from retail sales to coding shortly after discovering Hive Helsinki.  
Hive brought up my innate ability to solve problems and I enjoy finding patterns in code.  
I got instantly hooked and now after a bountiful year in school its time to test my skills in my first internship.

## About school

<p/>
Hive is free coding school funded by Supercell. As I started in oct 2021 totally new to all programming concepts,
I've attained great solid fundamentals for my professional career thanks to Hives "untraditional" learning methods.

- Back to source, all projects must be built from scratch:
  Allowed functions for most part: malloc, free and write;  
  Allowed library string.h for NULL and size_t variables;  
  
- Evaluation, emulates real life github process of getting ones code validated.
  All projects have to be evaluated 3 to 5 evaluationprocesses according to official project evaluation form  
  and evaluator-made rigorous tests
  
- Peer to peer, develops soft skills to excel in group-projects and develops the terminology
  No lessons, No teachers only student body to co-operate with. 
  
- Norm, rules to improve readability and predictability of ones code
  All code must be written according to the school 42 norm, which is multiple page document. 
  Designed to make code clearer. for example: All functions must be max 25 lines, 5 variables / function,
  5 functions / .c-file, 80 charecters / line, no variable assigning inside statements etc...
